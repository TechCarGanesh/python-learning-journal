 <b>About Me</b> 
  </p>
  
I am Ganesh Kumar and I am currently enrolled at De Anza College as a transfer student hoping to major in Computer Science.
My passion is to develop software in Python and C++ to build innovative tools and applications for data science and AI to help
solve challenging problems.
</p>
<p>
 <p>
   <b>Goals for This Course</b>
 </p>
My goals for the Advanced Python Programming course is to learn Object-Oriented Programming, Advanced Data Structures, and implementing 
efficient algorithms. I want to understand how a search engine works and explore an algorithm to implement an application to provide data
about plastic waste produced in various parts of the USA.

    <h1>My First Python Program</h1>

<p> &emsp; <em> print('hello world') # Printing hello world in single quotes.</em> </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> print("hello world") # Printing hello world in double quotes.</em> </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> print("he\nllo") # \n insert a new line (same as pressing Enter)</em> </p>

<p> # VARIABLES are named storage locations for numbers, strings, lists </p>
<p> # STRING is anything enclosed in quotes "Hello World", that's a string </p>
<p> # NUMBER can be either a FLOAT (Ex: 19.2) or an INTEGER (Ex: 20.0) </p>
<p> # LISTS are things like [1, 3, 5] or ["Ganesh", "Kumar"] </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> myName = "Ganesh" # declare/initialize string variable myName</em> </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> Weight = 130.5 # declare/initialize float variable Weight</em> </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> Age = 19 # declare/initialize int variable Age</em> </p>
<p> # Creating a Grades List with 89, 85, and 91. </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> Grades = [89, 85, 91]</em> </p>
<p> # nameZ List with two strings: Ganesh and Kumar </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> nameZ = ["Ganesh", "Kumar"]</em> </p>

<p> &emsp; <em> print ("Hello ", myName)</em> </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> print ("My weight is ", Weight, "and my age is ", Age)</em> </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> print ("My weight is %.2f and my age is %i" %(Weight, Age))</em> </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> print ("Lists: grades = ",Grades," nameZ= ",nameZ)</em> </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> print ("This is how you print", end=' ')</em> </p>
<p> &emsp; <em> print ("on the same line")</em> </p>
